# SigMaNet: One Laplacian to Rule Them All
This repository contains the implementation and testing code of different graph convolutional networks.

## Enviroment Setup
The experiments were conducted under this specific environment:

1. Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS
2. Python 3.8.10
3. CUDA 10.2
4. Torch 1.11.0 (with CUDA 10.2)
5. Pytorch Geometric Signed Directed [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/SherylHYX/pytorch_geometric_signed_directed)

## Repository structure

The repository contains two folders:
- **data** contains the syntactic graphs in *synthetic* and the WikiRfa dataset in *wikirfa*
- **src** contains all the model implementations used epr to run the experiments
